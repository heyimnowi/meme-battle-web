# meme-battle-web
Welcome to the Meme Battle Royale, a pet DeFi project for testing Solidity and React! In this simple voting app, you can pick the meme you like the most and see which one wins in the ultimate battle for meme supremacy.

## 📝 Summary
This project was created with Create React App and uses Solidity for the voting contract. It's a fun little app that demonstrates how DeFi and blockchain can be used for voting and decision-making.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meme-battle-royale.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `cd meme-battle-royale && npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Testing
To run the tests, you can use the command: `npm run test`. This will run all the tests in the src directory using Jest.

## 🏗 Building
To build the app for production, use the command: `npm run build`. This will create a build directory with the compiled files.

## 🤖 Ejecting
If you need more control over the configuration of your project, you can eject it using the command: `npm run eject`. This will remove the abstraction layer provided by Create React App and give you full control over your project configuration.
